WSJ do not have 24 hrs live broadcast
Individual program can be downloaded via RSS feeds, but hard to cater for individual audiance as we don't allow them to add their own program at this stage.
AOL provide similar service like BBC World Service, but not sure which one is more common in SG.
To cater local users, LJ and I feel good to add a local news station. What do you think YF?

Required but not important
(X)UI App, Warm user when they click back button "Do you want to Exit Program"
(X)UI App, Disable landscape mode
UI Info page, when user click weather, display more info, (WL) 
(X)UI Info page, when user click the other two, link to relevant setting page
UI Info page, display the proper next alarm in Info Page. (YF)
UI Alarm page, add check box and edit button, because many users are not aware long press will allow them to change time (LJ)


Further enhancement
Sync alarm among users
Allow user to add their own stations
